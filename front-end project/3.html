                <p>As a civil engineer there are many crossing career paths you can chose to be a Structural engineer
                    which
                    can lead to you
                    being a senior structural engineer, principal engineer structural, or Structural Engineer, Roads and
                    Bridges. Or you may
                    choose to be a Senior Civil Engineer which can lead you to be senior structural engineer, principal
                    engineer structural,
                    a structural engineer or an Senior Project Manager, Engineering. Perhaps you choose to be an
                    environmental engineer
                    witch might you to becoming a Project Engineer Environmental, or an Environmental Health & Safety
                    (EHS)
                    Manager</p>

                <h1>BE Computer</h1>
                <p>Computer engineering is a relatively new field of engineering and is one of the fastest growing
                    fields
                    today. Computer
                    engineering is one of today’s most technologically based jobs.


                    The field of computer engineering combines the knowledge of electrical engineering and computer
                    science
                    to create
                    advanced computer systems. Computer engineering involves the process of designing and manufacturing
                    computer central
                    processors, memory systems, central processing units, and of peripheral devices.

                    Computer engineers work with CAD(computer aided design) programs and different computer languages so
                    they can create and
                    program computer systems.</p>

                <p>Electronics engineering is the branch of electrical engineering, which deals with the uses of “the
                    electromagnetic
                    spectrum and with the application of such electronic devices as integrated circuits, transistors,
                    and
                    vacuum tubes”
                    (Allan, 2004).

                    Electrical engineering normally applies to the branch of engineering, which focuses on the use of
                    heavy
                    electric
                    current. This may include light, power, and other gadgets. On the other hand, electronics
                    engineering
                    relates to the
                    branch engineering, which uses light electric current.</p>

                <h1>M.Sc. Construction Management </h1>
                <p> Construction management is the term applied to the technique of managing the various designs and
                    construction processes
                    of a building project on behalf of an owner or client (Volume 2). Construction management became a
                    formal construction
                    concept in the 1970's by the Public Building Service of the U.S. General Services Administration
                    (GSA).
                    Before then,
                    when an owner wanted to start a new project, he would call upon an architect. Usually chosen on the
                    basis of reputation
                    and status, the architect would handle every aspect of the construction process from start to
                    finish.
                    For many years,
                    this construction process worked just fine.
